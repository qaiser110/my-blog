##Introduction

In this series, we'll build a mobile application in ReactNative, and also explore some of the development practices including directory structure, state management (in Mobx) code styling and linting tools (prettier, eslint, and arirbnb style guide), and an important, but often ignored part - testing your application (via jest and enzyme).

### Topics Covered

There are five parts in this series. We'll cover different parts for a full blown React Native application: 

1. In [part I](/react-native-tutorial/create-react-native-app-setup), we'll create React Native application using create-react-native-app CLI (CRNA)
2. In [part II](/react-native-tutorial/prettier-eslint-airbnb-styleguide), we'll setup prettier, eslint, and arirbnb style guide
3. In [part III](/react-native-tutorial/drawer-navigation-tabs-with-react-navigation), we'll add Drawer and Tabs Navigation using react-navigation
4. In [part IV](), we'll add a mobx store for the state management of our app
5. Add
